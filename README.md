# Airbnb First Booking Prediction

Ever wonder why you have certain promotion while your friends don't receive it? This business strategy is called personalized marketing. The goal of personalized marketing is to attract prospective customers and retain loyal customers. 

### Project Goal:
This project will attempt to classify whether or not new users will book the room services within a month after they create their airbnb accounts. After the classification, we can send personalized promotions to those who have created their accounts but have not made any booking yet within a month.

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
